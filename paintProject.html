<h1>
    Paint Project
</h1>
<h2>
    Overview
</h2>
<p>
    A simplified version of the Microsoft Paint application in Java. Utilized JavaFX GUI and various
    JavaFX shapes, paints, MouseEvents, and collections to achieve functional drawing application with
    options to choose paint color, brush size, use paint bucket and erase.<br><br><br>
</p>
<h2>
    Structure of GUI
</h2>
<p>
    The GUI is constructed from a base of a JavaFX Border Pane object. Border Panes allow one to set the
    different sections (Top, Bottom, Left, Right, Center) of the pane with different objects. On this Border
    Pane are two custom JavaFX objects. The center painting area of the screen is a custom Canvas object which is
    extended from the basic JavaFX Pane class. The top portion of the screen is a custom ToolsBar object which is
    extended from the JavaFX HBox class. Within the ToolsBar there is another custom ColorPalette object which is
    extended from the JavaFX GridPane class.<br><br>

<h3>
    Post Mapping
</h3>
<p>
    <img src="/images/postMappingImg.PNG" alt="Image of postMapping code listings"><br>
    This method handles Post requests to create new listings in the database by adding the JSON listing
    to the Listing Database. After adding the Listing to the Listing Database it returns the HTTPStatus CREATED.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="/images/postMappingImg2.PNG" alt="Image of postMapping code users"><br>
    A similar method was used to handle Post requests to create new users for the User Database.
    Because more complex information was required for users, a data transfer object (DTO) was needed as an
    intermediary between the JSON user post and the local User objects being stored in the User Database<br><br>
</p>
<h3>
    Get Mapping
</h3>
<p>
    <img src="/images/getMappingImg.PNG" alt="Image of getMapping code"><br>
    This method handles get requests to retrieve information about a Listing from the Listing Database.
    The Listing id is passed as a parameter. The listingService handles retrieving the Listing from the
    Listing Database and returns it in JSON format via a ResponseEntity.<br><br>
</p>
<h3>
    Delete Mapping
</h3>
<p>
    <img src="/images/deleteMappingImg.PNG" alt="Image of deleteMapping code"><br>
    This method handles delete requests to remove a Listing from the Listing Database.
    The Listing id is passed as a parameter. The listingService handles deleting the Listing from the Listing
    Database and returns a message with the id of the deleted Listing or a message saying there is no Listing
    with the specified id.<br><br><br>
</p>
<h2>
    Listing Service
</h2>
<p>
    <img src="/images/listingServiceImg.PNG" alt="Image of listingService code"><br>
    The Listing Service handles interacting with the Listing Database which is stored as a Spring repository.
    The Spring repository framework comes with basic create, read, update and delete (CRUD) functions.<br><br>
    <img src="/images/listingRepositoryImg.PNG" alt="Image of listingRepository code"><br>
    The Listing Service has basic methods for creating, retrieving, and deleting a Listing from the Listing Repository.
    These methods invoke some of the methods that come with the Spring repository. The various @ tags are tags that
    tell the Spring framework what certain methods and classes are to be used for.<br><br>
    <img src="/images/listingServiceImg2.PNG" alt="Image of listingService code methods"><br>
    A similar repository is used for storing the Users in the User Repository.<br><br><br>
</p>
<h2>
    Postman/Testing
</h2>
<p>
    <img src="/images/postmanImg.PNG" alt="Image of deleteMapping code"><br>
    To test the functionality of the Listing Webservice I used <a href="https://www.postman.com" target="_blank">Postman</a>,
    a REST Client able to send different types of HTTP requests to interact with the REST API webservice. Through
    the Postman extension I sent post, get and delete requests to the different paths of the webservice.
