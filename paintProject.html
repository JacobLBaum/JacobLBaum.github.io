<h1>
    Paint Project
</h1>
<h2>
    Overview
</h2>
<p>
    A simplified version of the Microsoft Paint application in Java. Utilized JavaFX GUI and various
    JavaFX shapes, paints, MouseEvents, and collections to achieve functional drawing application with
    options to choose paint color, brush size, use paint bucket and erase.<br><br><br>
</p>
<h2>
    Structure of GUI
</h2>
<p>
    The GUI is constructed from a base of a JavaFX BorderPane object. BorderPanes allow one to set the
    different sections (Top, Bottom, Left, Right, Center) of the pane with different objects. On this BorderPane there
    are two custom JavaFX objects. The center painting area of the screen is a custom Canvas object which is
    extended from the basic JavaFX Pane class. The top portion of the screen is a custom ToolsBar object which is
    extended from the JavaFX HBox class. Within the ToolsBar there is another custom ColorPalette object which is
    extended from the JavaFX GridPane class.<br><br>

</p>
<h2>
    Application
</h2>
<p>
    The Main class extends the JavaFX Application class which is the entry point for any JavaFX application.
    In JavaFX a Stage is the top level JavaFX container. This stage must be set with the different elements
    of the JavaFX program and then made to be visible to the user.
    The stage is set by first creating a BorderPane and setting the center to a Canvas object and the
    top to a ToolsBar object. Then a JavaFX Scene object is created with the BorderPane and the dimensions
    of the scene.The JavaFX Scene is another container that holds the content that is to be added to the
    application's Stage. Finally the scene is set in the primaryStage which adds all the elements of the
    application to the GUI to be displayed to the user.<br><br>

    The Main class also has the logic for the mouseEvents which control the program. When the Canvas is
    left clicked, circles are painted where the cursor is with the current pen size and color. When the Canvas
    is right clicked, the erase function is called creating circles the color of the background. When the Canvas
    is clicked with the middle mouse button, the "Paint Bucket" tool is called and all circles of the same color
    that are adjacent to the one clicked will be changed to the current pen color. The Canvas also responds to
    mouse drags with the left and right mouse button the same as it does for clicks. When the ToolsBar is
    clicked, the program attempts to identify which color the user clicked on from the ColorPalette. If the
    user clicks on either one of the other buttons or text fields in the ToolsBar or anywhere not on the
    ColorPalette, the pen color is unaffected. This functionality is set up like this because the ColorPalette
    is the only custom object in the ToolsBar that needs its clicking functionality coded; the button and
    text field work on their own when they are clicked.<br><br>

<h2>
    Custom Objects
</h2>
<h3>
    Tools Bar
</h3>
<p>

    The ToolsBar extends the JavaFX HBox. The HBox is a pane that displays its children in a single
    horizontal row. The ToolsBar arranges the elements in the order they are added in the
    getChildren().addAll() method.<br><br>
    The first element is the clear button which clears all the children from the canvas essentially
    wiping the canvas clean.<br><br>
    The next two elements are the text field box and its label for controlling the pen size,
    defaulted to 8.<br><br>
    The final element of the ToolsBar is the custom ColorPalette object which displays 8 different
    colors to choose from as the color for the pen.<br><br>

<h3>
    Color Palette
</h3>
<p>
    <img src="images/colorPaletteImg.PNG" alt="Image of colorPalette" width="50%" height="50%"><br><br>
    The ColorPalette extends the JavaFX GridPane. The GridPane is a pane that displays its children
    in a flexible grid of rows and columns. The various colors are displayed as rectangle objects with
    different colors. These rectangles are added to the ColorPalette and displayed for the user to
    choose from. When the user clicks on a colored rectangle, the color of the rectangle is checked
    and that color is set as the current pen color which is stored in the ColorPalette object. I chose
    to use the basic rainbow colors plus black and white to have a well balanced default palette.<br><br>

<h3>
    Canvas
</h3>
<p>
    The Canvas is where the actual "painting" takes place. The Canvas is extended from the basic JavaFX
    pane class as this class is the most flexible in terms of placing objects anywhere on the pane. The
    Canvas contains much of the logic for the program, most importantly the method for paintCircle which
    simply creates a circle based on an X and Y location and the current pen size and color. The erase method
    creates a circle the color of the background with the current pen size. Erasing is done by holding
    down the right mouse button. One alternative to creating circles the color of the background would be
    to delete any circles that are clicked on while holding down the right mouse button. This approach
    seems to be popular with other simple paint-like programs especially ones embedded in a program for
    which "painting" is not the main goal. Some examples are Windows' Snipping Tool pen and eraser and
    Microsoft Edge's PDF editing pen and eraser.<br><br>

    The Canvas also holds the logic for the "Paint Bucket" tool which is done by clicking the middle
    mouse button. The floodFill method has the most complex logic of the entire program as it must not
    only determine which circle you are trying to click on, but must also color all adjacent circles
    of the same color iterably. Picking the right circle that the user is attempting to click on proved
    difficult because the computer must know which circle at the given coordinates is on the "top" of
    the GUI even if there are multiple circle objects on the specified X and Y coordinates. Once the
    correct circle is chosen, the color is retrieved and all circles that are touching the clicked circle
    and are the same color are added to a List of circles to be changed. Those circles who were adjacent
    to the original circle then also have their neighbors checked to see if they are the same color. This
    continues until there are no more circles to check and all the neighboring circles of the same color
    are then changed to the current pen color.<br><br>
