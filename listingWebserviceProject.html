<h1>
    Listing Webservice
</h1>
<h2>
    Overview
</h2>
<p>
    A RESTFUL webservice in Java using Spring boot. Created
    simplified listing microservice to manage apartment units and users
    and answer REST requests from a database in JSON format.<br><br><br>
</p>
<h2>
    Spring Boot
</h2>
<p>
    Spring boot is a framework for creating web applications. On this project Spring
    gave me tools to configure responses to HTTP requests. Using the Spring tags
    @GetMapping, @PostMapping and @DeleteMapping I was able to dictate what response the webservice
    should have for Get, Post and Delete HTTP requests. Below you can see the methods with the relevant
    Spring headers for each of the HTTP request handlers.<br><br>
</p>
<h3>
    Post Mapping
</h3>
<p>
    <img src="/images/postMappingImg.PNG" alt="Image of postMapping code listings"><br>
    This method handles Post requests to create new listings in the database by adding the JSON listing
    to the Listing Database. After adding the Listing to the Listing Database it returns the HTTPStatus CREATED.
</p>
<p>
    <img src="/images/postMappingImg2.PNG" alt="Image of postMapping code users"><br>
    A similar method was used to handle Post requests to create new users for the User Database.
    Because more complex information was required for users, a data transfer object (DTO) was needed as an
    intermediary between the JSON user post and the local User objects being stored in the User Database<br><br>
</p>
<h3>
    Get Mapping
</h3>
<p>
    <img src="/images/getMappingImg.PNG" alt="Image of getMapping code"><br>
    This method handles get requests to retrieve information about a Listing from the Listing Database.
    The Listing id is passed as a parameter. The listingService handles retrieving the Listing from the
    Listing Database and returns it in JSON format via a ResponseEntity.<br><br>
</p>
<h3>
    Delete Mapping
</h3>
<p>
    <img src="/images/deleteMappingImg.PNG" alt="Image of deleteMapping code"><br>
    This method handles delete requests to remove a Listing from the Listing Database.
    The Listing id is passed as a parameter. The listingService handles deleting the Listing from the Listing
    Database and returns a message with the id of the deleted Listing or a message saying there is no Listing
    with the specified id.<br><br><br>
</p>
<h2>
    Listing Service
</h2>
<p>
    <img src="/images/listingServiceImg.PNG" alt="Image of listingService code"><br>
    The Listing Service handles interacting with the Listing Database which is stored as a Spring repository.
    The Spring repository framework comes with basic create, read, update and delete (CRUD) functions.<br><br>
    <img src="/images/listingRepositoryImg.PNG" alt="Image of listingRepository code"><br>
    The Listing Service has basic methods for creating, retrieving, and deleting a Listing from the Listing Repository.
    These methods invoke some of the methods that come with the Spring repository. The various @ tags are tags that
    tell the Spring framework what certain methods and classes are to be used for.<br><br>
    <img src="/images/listingServiceImg2.PNG" alt="Image of listingService code methods"><br>
    A similar repository is used for storing the Users in the User Repository.<br><br><br>
</p>
<h2>
    Postman/Testing
</h2>
<p>
    <img src="/images/postmanImg.PNG" alt="Image of deleteMapping code"><br>
    To test the functionality of the Listing Webservice I used <a href="https://www.postman.com" target="_blank">Postman</a>,
    a REST Client able to send different types of HTTP requests to interact with the REST API webservice. Through
    the Postman extension I sent post, get and delete requests to the different paths of the webservice.
